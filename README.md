## Vision

**For** people **who** want to apply for a job at UDL and the selection committee.

**the project** AcademicRecruit **is a** webapp created with Spring and Angular.

**that** allows them to check the process state.

**Unlike** existing tools, AcademicRecruit allows you to apply for a job virtually instead of in person.
