## Vision

**For** people **who** are members of a committeeMember.

**the project** AcademicRecruit **is a** webapp created with Spring and Angular.

**that** allows them manage the process state with the other members of the committeeMember group.

**Unlike** existing tools, AcademicRecruit allows to manage many candidatures virtually.
